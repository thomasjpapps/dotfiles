## Features
### Status Bar
My status bar was made using the default sway-bar however there are some custom changes. I've used a nerd font so that I can use the symbols in the status bar to make the overall look cleaner and less crowded.
### Workspace Buttons
Much like my status bar I am using nerd font so get the circles you see as the buttons. Alongside this I've also got a custom script set to be run so that whenever you change workspaces your currently focused one will have a solid circle.
### Sirula
Sirula is my app launcher of choice as I wanted to try something that wasn't just a rofi clone and this is what I landed on. Thoughts so far is that it's been great and super easy to customise.
## To do
I still have yet to polish off a few features.  
My status bar script needs to be polished up as it is currently a jamble of code snippets from stack overflow.  
I would like to find a way to space out my workspace buttons a little more than current.  
Finally I have a few more small tweaks for sirula.
