<h1>Welcome to my dotfiles</h1>
<p>This is my current working rice for my desktop.</p>
<p>It's based around my favourite game: Destiny 2</p>

<h2>Unique Features</h2>
<h3>Status Bar</h3>
<p>My status bar is done by using a bash script to get all the information.</p>
<p>I wanted to use the built in swaybar rather than install something else such as waybar, as such there are a lot of limitations.</p>
<h3>App Launcher</h3>
<p>I wanted to try my hand at creating my own app launcher and decided to have a play around in bash.</p>
<p>Currently you can set short cuts to programs or use it as a file manager but otherwise you have to enter the programs full name</p>
