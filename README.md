<h1>Welcome to my dotfiles</h1>
<p>This is my current working rice for my desktop.</p>
<p>It's based around my favourite game: Destiny 2</p>

<h2>Notes:</h2>
<p>I'm currently still trying different application launchers so have yet to settle.</p>
<p>The default keybinding for my theme is colemak so you may want to change this.</p>
<p>Finally, the status bar updates every 1 second as this is fine for my needs however if you may want to set this to 0.1 seconds for a more smooth volume/brightness update.</p>
