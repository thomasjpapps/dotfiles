# Welcome to my Dotfiles

## Features
### Status Bar
My status bar was made using the default sway-bar however there are some custom changes. I've used a nerd font so that I can use the symbols in the status bar to make the overall look cleaner and less crowded.
### Workspace Buttons
Much like my status bar I am using nerd font so get the circles you see as the buttons. Alongside this I've also got a custom script set to be run so that whenever you change workspaces your currently focused one will have a solid circle.
### Sirula
Sirula is my app launcher of choice as I wanted to try something that wasn't just a rofi clone and this is what I landed on. Thoughts so far is that it's been great and super easy to customise.

## Dependencies
### General:  
- `Sway`
- `Sirula`
- `Kitty`
- `Grim`
- `Slurp`
### Status Bar:  
- `Fira Code Nerd Font`
- `light`
- `acpi`
- `iwd`
- `date`
## Notes:  
I also execute some applications in my config which you most likely won't need or use.  
I use a custom keyboard layout and I recommend to change the `variant` variable at the top of `keys` to `us`.
