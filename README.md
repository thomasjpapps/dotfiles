<h1>Welcome to my dotfiles</h1>
<p>This is my current working rice for my desktop.</p>
<img src="sway/theme/desktop.png">
<h2>Unique Features</h2>
<h3>Status Bar</h3>
<p>My status bar is done by using a bash script to get all the information.</p>
<p>I wanted to use the built in swaybar rather than install something else such as waybar, as such there are a lot of limitations. But I'm still very happy with the outcome I've created.</p>
<h3>App Launcher</h3>
<p>I wanted to try my hand at creating my own app launcher and decided to have a play around in bash.</p>
<p>This has hit the back burner for the time being and instead I am using sirula as my app launcher.</p>
<h2>To Do</h2>
<h3>Status Bar</h3>
<p>Need to make it so my workspaces are in numerical order rather than the opened order</p>
